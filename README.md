# **EE2016 Microprocessors Lab overview**

* The main goal of this lab is to get familiar with the *assembly* programming and also to implement some good excercises.

* This course also laids some foundations on an important concept called *interrupt* programming which is very essential for some modern day devices.

* And at last to reach upto a level in which the tasks are implemented by using C language interfacing(leading us to the exploartion to the field of Embedded C and embedded systems)

* The following topics were learnt:
  - AVR Assembly Programming
  - AVR Interrupt Programming
  - ARM Assembly Programming
  - ARM C-Interface
  
* Ultimately, this course makes us to realize what a microprocessor is capable of and what wonders it can do.
